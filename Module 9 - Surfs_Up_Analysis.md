# MODULE 9 - SURFS UP ANALYSIS 

# OVERVIEW 
The surfs up challenge was here to provide temperature data for a friend who is looking to open up shop in Hawaii.  We were provided with a set of weather data from Hawaii with various data types including precipitation and other but for this analysis we are just looking at temperatures on various dates.  The results show an overview of temperatures for the months of June and December throughout the years.  
  

# RESULTS
    
Overall Results:   
    First on the June Temps table shown in the analyssi is count which simply means we have X number data points in our analysis showing a solid base of data to draw from.  Next is the mean and std (standard deviation) which just gives us the average temperature along with the variance from that average point.  The next breakdown going from min --> 25% --> 50% --> 75% --> Max is the temperatue at those ranges or points of the data spread.  We can interepret from these points how closely the various spread of temperatures is throughout the month.   NOTE: this includes all years in the data set.  This is


June results:
    For the month of June we have 1700 data poitns which is enough for one odd temperature point not to throw off the averages.  The mean is 74.9 with a standard deviation of 3.25 which we can infer is not a wide spread of temperature.  Though the minimum here is 64, the rest of the percentage values are all in the 70s until the max is 85.  We can tell from this that it is a safe assumption the temperature will be in the 70s throughout June with an outlier for cold days in the high 60s and vice versa for extra hot days to get up into the 80s.  

December Results:
    Again with 1517 counts we have a solid set of data to give us good reliability.  The mean for December is 71 which makes sense it would be cooler than June but it is still in the range of temps we would want for surfing & ice cream.  The minimim is 56 which means we could get a cold spell occaisionally but with the 25% point being at 69 this is still a solid indicator of our business.  Lastly the max temp being 83 is solid enough and comparible to June that we don't see any problems with our plans to move forward on our business based on temperature.


# SUMMARY
The results of this analysis provide a high level breakdown of temperatures in the month of June and December.  Further review & analysis that would be helpful are graphs that show the spread of temperatues and how the averages/date have changed from year to year.  The further queries in the file provide the same high level breakdown for rain amounts in the months of June and December.
